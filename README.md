# Uses Per Encounter

Items can set to have Limited Uses per Encounter.
These uses function the same as other Limited Use types, but are automatically replenished when the actor leaves combat.

### Technical Notes
A new `encounter` key is added to `CONFIG.DND5E.limitedUsePeriods`. Item sheets use this object to create the select options for Limited Uses.

When a combatant is removed from combat (combatant or combat is deleted), the module filters the corresponding actor's items for items with `item.data.data.uses.per === "encounter"`. These items are then updated to replenish the use value to the set max.
